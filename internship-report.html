<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
To meet the needs of colleges without adequate laboratory facilities, Virtual
Labs provides online lab simulations. Many of the labs and associated
animations are created using Flash. Some of the labs are built with
JavaScript. Using Flash-based labs provides compatibility issues and hence,
conversion of these labs is a dire necessity. In this project, we have converted
the majority of the experiments in the Molecular Absorption Spectroscopy Lab
(made by IIIT Hyderabad) using pure Javascript. We have also explored two major
tools that could be used for similar lab building to make the entire process
easier. We have alos come across, but not explored in depth various other
online frameworks and tools that can be used to do the same.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
We would like to acknowledge the guidance given to us by Professor Venkatesh
Chopella of IIIT Hyderabad. He has been key in steering us in the right
direction by suggesting paths of exploration as well as helping us understand
the relevance of what we were doing. We would also like to thank the mentors at
VLEAD for making our life simple and helping us understand basics of Linux and
Git.

<h2 id="orgheadline10"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> The Pure JavaScript Approach</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Here, we first analyze the method we used, using pure JavaScript.   
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline6"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Methodology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
</div><div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline4"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.1</span> Converting Existing Experiments</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-1">
<p>
+Most labs are made up of images. Now, using any photo editor,(the version
 depends on the complexity of the lab) we can deconstruct a lab into various
 photos. These photos can be treated as objects and various methods can be
 applied to them, thus rendering the setup a virtual lab. 
</p>

<p>
+Thus, all animations and interactions are done with already made images as supposed to  
 tailor made ones. This includes rotation, translation and simple property
 changes of images. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline5"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.2</span> Constructing New Experiments</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The main area of focus here is in building new experiments. Now, it can be
seen that it can be easy to accumulate a repository of images for a single
experiment and then tailor the code to meet the needs of the user. However,
this method can also be used to create a basic skeleton for a set of
experiments, all falling under the umbrella of a lab.</li>

<li>For instance, in our lab, we have recurring beakers, spectrometers and
other such apparatus. A simple object relational model can be developed
using JavaScript to pander to the needs of the lab.</li>

<li>This can be expanded to build various lab kits, thus allowing a user to
construct his own lab/experiment. For this, a simple drag and drop method
can be employed to do so.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline7"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> Where This Approach Succeeds</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
The pros of this approach lie in the fact that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
As supposed to Flash, this isn't frame by frame animation. This
effectively implies that a user can perform an experiment in multiple
ways, as supposed to a way suggested by the creator. This promotes
increased interactivity by allowing the user to formulate his/her own procedure.
</p>

<p>
++ Where we are in this now:
   As such, we haven't built any new experiments. However, a significant
   change can be noticed in the usage of any of the experiments in the
   given lab. Apparatus can be used in different orders as supposed to in
   the counterpart Flash experiment. This is a step forward, but many of
   the components of the lab still require a chronological way of
   operation.
</p>

<p>
++ Ways to Move Forward:
   The main solution here lies in building lab kits. These, when built with
   higher levels of abstraction, will help in increased interactivity. This
   will work best when developing the labs with well-defined objects and
   object relational models. With more abstraction comes a more complicated
   network of relations. 
</p></li>

<li>Compatibility is a major advantage here. As can easily be seen,
JavaScript is compatible with all current browsers, and so is HTML5. This
approach thus overcomes compatibility issues.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline9"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Drawbacks of the Approach</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For conversion, working with an image repository can sometimes be somewhat
of an inconvenience. This is due to both issues with positioning and
animations. Actions such as those need to be coded manually in each case,
and general methods and functions can't be applied.</li>
<li>This also creates issues in developing new experiments. With a higher
level of abstraction comes a need for standardization. However,
standardizing already existing images that need to be added to a
repository is a bit of a challenge as various attributes will be altered
in doing so.</li>
<li>This level of abstraction also poses a bigger challenge as specialized
interactions between objects cannot all be accounted for. This will then,
need to be hard coded again. Grouping experiments of a lab together, will
then sometimes be difficult.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline8"><span class="section-number-4">4.3.1</span> Moving Forward</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-3-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Standardization of image sizes is key here. This needs to be done through
either thorough searching, or careful photo editing. To avoid this, image
size and types can be categorized into further types.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orgheadline11"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Motivation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Understandably, it's easier to work with tools. This provides various
advantages, including reusability of code as well as shortening of it.
</p>

<h4 id="orgheadline12"><span class="section-number-4">5.2.1</span> Introduction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-1">
<p>
<a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> is a drawing framework with similar goals as the Processing language. It
helps in convenient implementation of interactivity and animation with the
capacity to introduce objects and style them easily.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-orgheadline13" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline13"><span class="section-number-4">5.2.2</span> Areas of Use</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-2">
<p>
There are many uses of p5, relevant to the context of creating a lab. These
include:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Easier implementation of methods to HTML elements, seeing as they can be
created from the script. This includes creating buttons, sliders,etc.</li>
<li>Rotation of objects is much simpler, seeing as direct rotation methods are
available. Although JQuery can be used to achieve the same purpose, it
should be noted that p5 helps integrate everything into one piece of code,
and helps in simplifying it quite a bit.</li>
<li>Drawing simple shapes is possible through p5. This helps in creating
schematics of new experiments, after which a graphical interface can be
applied.</li>
<li>In various experiments with graphing, p5 provides graphing
libraries (developer contributed). These, coupled with animations can help
in plotting time dependent graphs were needed.</li>
<li>Use in experiments is possible as well, using multiple <a href="https://p5js.org/libraries/">user created libraries</a>.</li>
<li>There exist in built animation functions which run fast loops, thereby
making repetition/iteration significantly easier.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline14" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline14"><span class="section-number-4">5.2.3</span> Drawbacks</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>p5 creates a canvas upon which drawing an animation can be done. This
makes interactions with other HTML elements difficult.</li>
<li>It can be overcome by awkward methods of moving your canvas around, which
could also lead to blocks in the case of complex animation.</li>
<li>It doesn't shorten the code for some experiments much. However it has user
contributed libraries that can help in others, for instance, collision
libraries for civil engineering labs.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It makes for convenient creating of divisions, shapes and other various
but simple objects. Styling can also be done easily.</li>
<li>It can be used for 3D object manipulation. This, however doesn't have much
scope as far as the current labs are considered.</li>
<li>It can make simple animations without having to dive into the source

<h4 id="orgheadline18"><span class="section-number-4">5.3.3</span> Drawbacks</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is in its beta version, and hence runs into various bugs (further
described)</li>
<li>There is a lack of documentation thus preventing full implementation of
all the features.</li>
<li>It doesn't incorporate functions like sliders and menus, which are common in the
experiments of lab.</li>
<li>If a small change in functionality is required, the user is unable to
modify and then use the generated code. Thus,specific results cannot be
realized.</li>
<li>In some machines, the generated code can't even be accessed, again, a
result of it being in beta version.</li>
<li>Certain buttons and features don't have any effect when done in sequence
with something else.</li>
<li>It is generally used for advertisements and can only thus perform simple
CSS animations.</li>
<li>You can't append existing code to generated code and edit it.</li>
<li>The usage of the generated code is limited to only certain browsers. We
ran into problems with Firefox and we found similar complaints about
Opera-GWD compatibility.</li>
<li>Code generated runs into some issues when published and opened using
Firefox. The code sometimes hangs and the browser becomes unresponsive.</li>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline21" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline21"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
We have experimented with multiple methods in an attempt to find an easier
way to convert simple animated experiments in Flash to JavaScript, given its
universal compatibility. 
First, we played around with some JavaScript frameworks that we thought might
be useful, most significantly <a href="http://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. We also made a few simple animations
using this to understand the framework and its usage better. In the process, we ran into many other
libraries, which would be of use in other kinds of situations.
We also tried using Google Web Designer, a tool built to make ads in
webpages. However, we faced issues with this too, some reasons for that being
that the tool is still in beta and does not have proper documentation on its
usage.
</p>

<p>
The main path of future progress is in creating lab kits. Special focus needs
to be given to the levels of abstraction, thus helping developers as well as
users.
